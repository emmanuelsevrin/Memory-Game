# Memory Game Project

This code displays a memory game. 

## Rules

The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match.

## Performance

To get a good score, you will want to minimize the number of moves you have to make to match all cards. You earn a good star rating by performing under a specific code limit: 
* Three stars: under 30 moves
* Two stars: under 50 moves
* One star: Above 50 moves

You can also try to minimize the time spent solving the game. The timer starts when you first click on a card.

## Installation

To install this game, simply download the entire repository and open the index file in your preferred browser. You can then start the game simply by clicking on a card of your choice. You do not need to have any package preinstalled
